Exercise 1 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)


name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

centenarian_year = 2019 - age + 100

if age > 100:
    print ("You already turned 100 in ", centenarian_year)

elif age < 3:
    print("You're just a baby! You don't need to worry about that!")

else:

    print (name, "will turn one hundred in", centenarian_year)

    reprint = int(input("How many more times would you like to print that out? "))

    for n in range(reprint):
        print (name, "will turn one hundred in", centenarian_year)





Exercise 2 (and Solution)
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.


number = int(input("Enter a number to see if it's odd or even: "))

if number % 2 == 0 and number % 4 != 0:
    print (number, "is an even number.")
elif number % 2 == 0 and number % 4 == 0:
    print(number, "is an even number which is divisible by 4.")
else:
    print (number, "is an odd number.")


#Extra 2:


num = int(input("Enter a number to divide: "))
check = int(input("Enter a number to divide by: "))

if num % check == 0:
    print (check, "divides evenly into", num)
else:
    print (num, "is not divisible by", check)




Exercise 3 (and Solution)
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.


def lessthanten(lst):
    new_list = []
    for num in lst:
        if num <5:
            new_list.append(num)
    print (new_list)

#Extra 2:

def lessthanten(lst):
    print ([num for num in lst if num <5])

#Extra 3:

topnum = int(input("Enter a number "))

def lessthanten(lst):
    new_list = []
    for num in lst:
        if num <topnum:
            new_list.append(num)
    print (new_list)




Exercise 4 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


user_num = int(input("Enter your number to see its divisors: "))

for num in range(2, user_num):
    if user_num % num == 0:
        print (num)





Exercise 5 (and Solution)
Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:

Randomly generate two lists to test this
Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)


def twolist(a,b):
    new_list = []
    for num in a:
        if num in b:
            new_list.append(num)
    print (new_list)


#Extra 1:

import random

random_list_1 = random.sample(range(100), 25)
random_list_2 = random.sample(range(100), 25)
new_list = []

for num in random_list_1:
    if num in random_list_2:
        new_list.append(num)
print (new_list)


#Extra 2:

def twolist(a,b):
    print (set(a)&set(b))
